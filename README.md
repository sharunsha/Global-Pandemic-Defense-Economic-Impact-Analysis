# Global-Pandemic-Defense-Economic-Impact-Analysis
Interactive Tableau dashboard assessing country-level defense vulnerability using attack–recovery risk metrics.
Global Pandemic Impact Analysis (Tableau Project)
Overview
This project analyzes how different countries were impacted during global pandemic conditions.
Using data collected from WHO, IMF, World Bank, and Our World in Data (OWID), the study visualizes:
GDP loss across countries
Medical spending patterns
Defense level vs. economic loss
Global risk distribution
Country-level COVID statistics (cases, deaths, survival rate, infection ratio, etc.)
Two interactive Tableau dashboards were designed to explore these insights visually.



📂 Dataset

🚀 How to Open the Dashboard

Download the .twbx file from this repository
Open it using Tableau Public or Tableau Desktop
Explore both dashboards interactively

🎯 Key Insights
Countries with low defense & low medical spending show higher GDP loss
Developed nations have higher spending but show controlled infection ratios
The risk matrix helps classify countries into High-Risk, Moderate, and Low-Risk zones
Vaccination rate strongly correlates with survival rate
